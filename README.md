# Tom Shows - Youtube Channel

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my planned, published and translated
scripts for an upcoming Youtube's show/channel called **Tom Shows**

As of today I haven't released any of the episodes yet because I'm experimenting with the 
format, my public speaking and the episodes itself. I've never done ANY videos and youtubing
before. This is the opposite of my own comfort zone and a learning experience I'm willing
to take. I'm 100% sure I'll make a fool of myself but in return grow some pair.

While I'm learning and embarrassing myself, i might aswell show you some nifty things in 
the programming world. And exactly this will keep me afloat. I believe everybody can and
should learn at least some coding. You wouldn't believe how exciting and surpisingly 
simple that actually is. My goal: show you the cool and joyful parts of programming. If 
someone would ask me if I would trade my coding/webdesign knowledge with something different
I probably wouldn't. My job is to make you feel the same way. Hell... i love it and so 
should you.

## Episode Scripts

Episodes are devided into seasons (just like a TV show). Each season follows a theme
to give the viewer an exciting experience through the past of computer science. It's
an experiment as well, I've yet to find something similar in any educational video.

### Season 1 - 2018 - The 80's - 90's / ascii attacks with the first line of code

The 80's. VHS, Atari, Unix, Windows 1.0 and Pixelart at it's finest. The same time computers 
and programming became popular.
