###### First impression counts, better show what you did rather than pretend you know things.
You are probably asking yourself, why am I pretending to read a coding book and look smart?
The first impression counts, right? To be fair, I have already read this book and I still don't
consider myself smart at all. Everything can be learned one way or another and here is the thing,
one should never stop learning. But when it comes to impressions, do you trust somebody when
he tells you he knows his profession? Or would you rather work with somebody who can show you how 
he learned all those things?

###### Everybody has fun doing what gets them excited
My first webdesign gig was in the year 2004. Back then I was 20 yrs old, kind of na√Æve and 
wanted to earn easy money. Haha, this sounds like a dirty movie intro. 
Programming and designing - I loved those. I wasn't good at it but at least I had an eye for 
esthetics and fun solving logical puzzels. This in turn fueled my excitement when I was testing 
out new programming things and trying to replicate new webdesigns I've found browsing.

###### Everybody starts somewhere
Back then websites were designed horendously. If you found a nice looking website, it was mostly
stitched together with a grid and images looking like it was a unique webdesign. It was well-
crafted in a paint program, definitely. The code itself not so elegant at all. Simple shiny
hover effects and nice looking buttons. Nothing fancy. Copying or replicating another persons 
webdesign was very simple this way. Learning to webdesign this way was kind of fun tbh.

###### It's not important how you start
Many programs ( Microsoft Frontpage e.g. ) got you going pretty fast. Those websites you can hack 
together didn't even look bad and came pretty close to the well-crafted ones I found. Approximately
at that time I decided to create websites professionally. 
So I teamed up with my brother and we designed a preview page of a backery website. We used 
Corel Draw for this and well.. overdesigned a little but the overall look&feel felt really nice. 
We just made sure that coding was easier than drawing it.
The client we wanted to win: a pastry and cake shop near my parents hometown.

###### Convince client, don't sell yourself short
Our first goal: convice the client he needs a new website. He only had a business card - like website 
at that time. The trending things back then: websites with galleries and a small roadmap where to 
find the shop. So we thought convincing will be easy. And surprisingly it was, with only one catch: 
We had to lie the whole interview about our expertise. The truth was, we had none.

###### Create you portfolie slowly but surely
Without a portfolio of websites, designs or coded programs how can you convince somebody that
you are the perfect fit for a job? You can't. But you can show your client what your capable
of doing. We showed our client 2 simple webdesign templates we found that we printed out. No
tablets that time. It worked, we got the job.
The website was terrible.. but it was our first portfolio piece that opened the door to up-
coming other projects, everytime learning something new. I'm very happy that we did it.

###### Conclusion
What am I trying to tell you here. 

I'm Tom, I'm a programmer and I'm going to show you webdesign, coding and more nerdy stuff. Hope
you'll like it.

#### TOM (V.O.)(CONT'D)

I'm the kind of guy that googles "How to properly introduce yourself", read through a pile
of awkwardly sounding articles and deciding to do it better or watch a TED-Talk instead.

Same happens when I'm coding. TBD
