> First impression counts, better show what you did rather than pretend you know things.

I don't like reading books. Harry Potter, meh. Any kind of fiction honestly. However I do like
watching netflix. Playing games or listening to great music. It's kind of strange. Based on books and scripts
movies are made. Notes are written on paper and music played off of it. Everything great is created in some way. 

I do like reading one specific kind of books, believe it or not. These are books where you can learn something.
...

Now consider programming for a moment. Painfully writing some algorithm or markup text that only nerds do
understand. What's the point? Now go back to what you actually like: computer games, websites, apps, 3d 
some coder, somewhere around the world made. Coders are the secret rock stars 

To be fair, I have already read this book and I still don't consider myself smart at all. 
Everything can be learned one way or another and here is the thing,
one should never stop learning. But when it comes to impressions, do you trust somebody when
he tells you he knows his profession? Or would you rather work with somebody who can show you how 
he learned all those things?

> Everybody has fun doing what gets them excited

My first webdesign gig was in the year 2004. Back then I was 20 yrs old, kind of naÃ®ve and 
wanted to earn easy money. Haha, this sounds like a dirty movie intro. 
Programming and designing - I loved those. I wasn't good at it but at least I had an eye for 
esthetics and fun solving logical puzzels. This in turn fueled my excitement when I was testing 
out new programming things and trying to replicate new webdesigns I've found while browsing.

> Everybody starts somewhere

Back then websites were designed horendously. If you found a nice looking website, it was mostly
stitched together with a grid and images looking like it was a unique webdesign. It was well-
crafted in a paint program, definitely. The code itself not so elegant at all. Simple shiny
hover effects and nice looking buttons. Nothing fancy. Copying or replicating another persons 
webdesign was very simple this way. Learning to webdesign this way was kind of fun tbh.

> It's not important how you start

Many programs ( Microsoft Frontpage e.g. ) got you going pretty fast. Those websites you can hack 
together didn't even look bad and came pretty close to the well-crafted ones I found. Around that 
time I played with the idea to create websites "professionally". 
I teamed up with my brother and we designed a preview page of a backery website. We used 
Corel Draw for this and well.. overdesigned a little but the overall look&feel felt really nice. 
We just made sure that coding was easier than drawing it.
The client we needed to convince: a pastry and cake shop near my parents hometown.

> Convince client, don't sell yourself short

First step: convice the client he needs a new website. He only had a business card - like website 
at that time. The trending things back then: websites with galleries and a small roadmap where to 
find the shop. So we thought convincing will be easy. And surprisingly it was, with only one catch: 
We had to lie the whole interview about our expertise. The truth was, we had none.

> Create you portfolie slowly but surely

Without a portfolio of websites, designs or coded programs how can you convince somebody that
you are the perfect fit for a job? You can't. But you can show your client what your capable
of doing. We showed our client 2 simple webdesign templates we printed that would fit his niche. 
It worked, we got the job.
In retrospect the website was terrible.. but it was our first portfolio piece that opened the door 
to upcoming other projects, everytime learning something new. I'm very happy that we did it. 

> Conclusion

What am I trying to tell you here: I'm just a dude working as a coder. 

I'm Tom, I'm a programmer and I'm going to show you webdesign, coding and more nerdy stuff. Hope
you'll like it.

#### TOM (V.O.)(CONT'D)

I'm the kind of guy that googles "How to properly introduce yourself", read through a pile
of awkwardly sounding articles and deciding to do it better or watch a TED-Talk instead.

Same happens when I'm coding. TBD
