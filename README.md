# Tom Shows - Youtube Channel

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my planned, published and translated scripts for an upcoming Youtube's show/channel called **Tom Shows**

As of today I haven't released any of the episodes yet because I'm experimenting with the format, my public speaking and the episodes itself. I've never done ANY videos and youtubing before. This is the opposite of my own comfort zone and a learning experience I'm willing to try out. I'm 100% sure I'll make a fool of myself but in return grow some pair.

While I'm learning and embarrassing myself, I might aswell show you some nifty things in the programming world. Or atleast how I became a programmer. And exactly this will keep me afloat. I believe everybody can and should learn at least some coding. It's like capentry. Of course you can just buy a nice table that can cost a fortune. Have you never though about build one yourself with the instructions of professionals? Well I do all the time, be it cooking, carpentry, video creation, photography, digital art, gardening, coffee making... I can go on forever. Long story short: it's so fun and exciting once you get the hang of it, you wouldn't believe. 

My goal for this channel: show you the cool and joyful parts of programming, hacking and the mindset behind it. If someone would ask me if I would trade my coding/webdesign knowledge with something different, I probably wouldn't. My job is to make you feel the same way. Hell... I love coding and so should you. Let me at least try to convince you just a little.

## Episode Scripts
  
Episodes are devided into seasons (just like a TV show). Each season follows a theme to give the viewer an exciting experience through the past of computer science. It's an experiment as well, I've yet to find something similar in any educational video.

The format and timeline are unclear; season endings and beginning as well. I will be aiming for weakly episodes. That ammounts to approx. 52 weaks a year. Round 2 weeks of holidays and you have some juicy 50 episodes per season. Sheesh... that's much.

To fill the huge demand (only if) I'll need to include some Q&A episodes and suggestions for upcoming episodes. This is where my [twitter](https://twitter.com/tom_siwik) comes in handy. Every end of the month episode for Q&A and 3rd week of the month user suggestions? Sounds about right doesn't it?

### Season 1 - The 80's - 90's / ascii attacks with the first line of code

The 80's. VHS, Atari, Unix, Windows 1.0 and Pixelart at it's finest. The same time computers and programming became popular. It became a new era with a lot of experimentation and launches of new concepts. This season will focus on the introduction in the programming world.
