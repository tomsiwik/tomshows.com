# S01E01 - Editors

## Why?

This episode's goal is to introduce the audience (potentially new programmers) 
to certain types of editors that are useful for programming. 

## What?

There are three types of editors that can be used (not solely) for programming:

- Text-only editors: used to write text just like in a typerwriter (distraction
  free)
- Code editors: these editors highlight your programming language and ship with
  additional features useful for programmers.
- WYSIWYG editors: mostly used for mouse interactions and autogenerating code
  so users can create and be productive as fast as possible.

## How?
