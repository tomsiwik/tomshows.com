> I hate books

You will never see me read any kind of fiction. But look at that, why is it that there are so many books
on my shelf? The reason is simple:

> I love learning

I love to learn how to create things. How to understand them and get an "Aha!" moment. It's strange: while
I really dislike reading fiction, someone out there actually wrote that book. It might have been rewritten
into a script by somebody else. Someone else filmed and produced a movie or a tv show base off of it. And 
there I'm sitting in front of the TV actually liking the resulting show. I might be even interested on a book
on how to create a movie by myself.

> Do you dislike programming?

Now consider programming for a moment. Painfully writing some algorithm or markup text that only nerds do
understand. What's the point? Code in a way is like writing a novel. To some people it makes sense, others
don't really like it and others take your work and put more effort into it to create something new and exciting.
It might look totally different to the original. Maybe this fancy new algorithm is simply used on the web as
a cool animation.

Just like me disliking books, you don't really need to like programming either. But would you consider looking 
into the craft of, let's say creating a nice webdesign? With just the basics of programming? Just like the actor 
knows how to read a script?

> This is coding!

Welcome to the world of web development. The hipster world of software engineering. The ocean of weird stuff,
with books you might start to enjoy eventhough you dislike reading them but want to look like a cool coder.
Aaaand, Hi...
