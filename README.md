# Tom Shows - Youtube Channel

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my planned, published and translated
scripts for an upcoming Youtube's show/channel called **Tom Shows**

As of today I haven't released any of the episodes yet because I'm experimenting with the 
format, my public speaking and the episodes itself. I've never done ANY videos and youtubing
before. This is the opposite of my own comfort zone and a learning experience I'm willing
to take. I'm 100% sure I'll make a fool of myself but in return grow some pair.

While I'm learning and embarrassing myself, I might aswell show you some nifty things in 
the programming world. And exactly this will keep me afloat. I believe everybody can and
should learn at least some coding. You wouldn't believe how exciting and surpisingly 
simple that actually is. My goal: show you the cool and joyful parts of programming / 
hacking. If someone would ask me if I would trade my coding/webdesign knowledge with 
something different, I probably wouldn't. My job is to make you feel the same way. 
Hell... I love coding and so should you.

## Episode Scripts
 
Episodes are devided into seasons (just like a TV show). Each season follows a theme
to give the viewer an exciting experience through the past of computer science. It's
an experiment as well, I've yet to find something similar in any educational video.

The format and timeline are unclear; season endings and beginning as well. I will be
aiming for weakly episodes. That ammounts to approx. 52 weaks a year. Round 2 weeks of
holidays and you have some juicy 50 episodes per season. Sheesh... that's much.

To fill the huge demand I'll need to include some Q&A episodes and suggestions for
upcoming episodes. This is where my [twitter](https://twitter.com/tom_siwik) comes in 
handy. Every end of the month episode for Q&A and 3rd week of the month user 
suggestions? Sounds about right doesn't it?
