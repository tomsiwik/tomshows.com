# S01E00 - Hello World

## Why?

This episode's goal is to say hello to the youtube community in a creative, funny
and catching way. A humble start leads the way for future episodes to come.

## What?

Introducing three characters:

- A computer: symbolizes programming, coding and computer science in general. Or the
  villain that needs to be contained/controlled.
- A narrator: the question-asker that dramatizes and encourages the audience to think
  about the story and challenge the problems in the episodes.
- A hero: the friendly hacker, that knows programming and is willing to share his insights
  so that the audience can benefit from it.

With people knowing some programming there will be a happy ending.

## How?

Introduce the computer: powerful and dangerous machine that can destroy humanity but is
actually nice (anti-hero).
Introduce the programmer: eager to learn, willing to show but sometimes clumsy or 
confused (hero).
Introduce the problem: coding/computers are hard to master to ~~earn money~~ have a great
adventure.
