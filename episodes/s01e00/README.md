# S01E00 - Hello World

## Why?

This episode's goal is to say hello to the youtube community in a creative, funny
and catching way. A humble start leads the way for future episodes to come. This
episode is also used to get a feeling of time when recording and speaking. 

## What?

Introducing three characters:

- A computer: symbolizes programming, coding and computer science in general. Or the
  villain that needs to be contained/controlled.
- A narrator: the question-asker that dramatizes and encourages the audience to think
  about the story and challenge the problems in the episodes.
- A hero: the friendly hacker, that knows programming and is willing to share his insights
  so that the audience can benefit from it.

With people knowing some programming there will be a happy ending.

## How?

Introduce the computer: powerful and dangerous machine that can destroy humanity but is
actually nice (anti-hero).
Introduce the programmer: eager to learn, willing to show but sometimes clumsy or 
confused (hero).
Introduce the problem: coding/computers are hard to master to ~~earn money~~ have a great
adventure.

# Script

## Part 1: Catcher

Once upon a time, there was the computer. By itself it couldn't do much. Used by evil forces 
however, a dangerous machine.

Then came the programmer. By himself he couldn't do much. Books, knowledge and passion are his 
specialties. 

	Narrator: Sign, no... not that one. Yeah... much better.

From today, computer and human, let's join forces and code for ~~money~~ adventures! This shall
mark the beginning of: Tom Shows.

## Part 2: Intro

*Showing intro*

## Part 3: Preface

*Back to office with Tom sitting in front of camera.*

	**Tom:** Hey Friends. Welcome to my new series of Tom Shows. 
	
	You may have notice, that programmer guy is me. I've recorded this a few weeks before as
	an experiment.
	
	And yes, this show is all about coding, hacking and nifty nerdy stuff. Hopefully in a more
	exciting way than those 'teaching' shows though.

	So for now, just stay tuned. If you have some suggestions already, than hey... comment below. 
	It's youtube after all, we are in this together.

	I guess this is it. See you next time aaand (as always) happy hacking!
