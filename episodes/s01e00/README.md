###### First impression counts
You are probably asking yourself, why am I pretending to read a coding book and look smart?
The first impression counts, right? To be fair, I have already read this book and I still don't
consider myself smart at all. Everything can be learned one way or another and here is the thing,
I still haven't stopped learning. But when it comes to impressions, do you trust somebody when
he tells you he knows his profession? Or would you rather work with somebody who can show you
what he has accomplished?

###### Everybody has fun doing what gets them excited
My first webdesign gig was in the year 2004. Back then I was 20 yrs old, kind of na√Æve and wanted to 
earn easy money. Haha, this sounds like a dirty movie intro. 
Programming and designing - I loved those. I wasn't good at it but at least I had an eye for esthetics
and fun solving logical puzzels which in turn fueled my excitement when I was testing out new things.

###### Everybody starts somewhere
Back then websites were designed horendously. They all looked the same and were uncreative and
uninspiring. If you had some common sense about design and the eye for it you were better than
most of the webdesigners out there. But one thing was cumbersome and uncomfortable to learn: coding.

###### It's not important how you start
Many programs ( Microsoft Frontpage e.g. ) got you going pretty fast. Those websites you can hack 
together didn't even look bad. So I teamed up with my brother and we designed a preview page of a 
backery website. We used Corel Draw for this and well.. overdesigned a little. The client we wanted to win: 
a pastry and cake shop near my parents hometown.

###### Convince client, don't sell yourself short
Our first goal: convice the client he needs a website. He only had a business card - like website 
at that time. The trendy thing back then: websites with galleries and a small roadmap where to 
find it. So we thought convincing will be easy. And surprisingly it was, with only one catch: 
We had to lie the whole interview about our expertise. The truth was, we had none.

###### Create you portfolie slowly but surely
Without a portfolio of websites, designs or coded programs how can you convince somebody that
you are the perfect fit for a job? You can't. But you can show your client what your capable
of doing. Show him that your effort and time is worth to pay for it. I'm happy we got the job.
The website was terrible.. but it was our first portfolio piece that opened the door to up-
coming other jobs, everytime learning something new.

Hi. My name is Tom, I'm a programmer and I'm going to show you webdesign, coding and more.

#### TOM (V.O.)(CONT'D)

I'm the kind of guy that googles "How to properly introduce yourself", read through a pile
of awkwardly sounding articles and deciding to do it better or watch a TED-Talk instead.

Same happens when I'm coding. TBD
