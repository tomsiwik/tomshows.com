> I hate books

Seriously. I don't like sitting hours clumped up and force myself to finish a story. I'd almost always rather watch 
a movie instead. I simply have no patience and you will never see me read any kind of fiction. But look at this.

These are all my coding books, visual design literature and some other self-development stuff. Hurr?? Didn't I just
say I hate books? More than anything...

> I do love learning though

It kinda weights out?! I love to learn how to create things, I mean who doesn't?! To understand how things work in 
general. Just look at Kurzgesagt and you'll know what I'm talking about. I'm basically always on the search for the 
"Aha!" moment. It's strange: while I really dislike reading fiction, someone out there actually wrote that novel/book 
or whatever. At some point he learned how to do it. His creation might have been taken by somebody else and entirely 
rewritten...
maybe into a script. Someone else took this work, starting rolling a camera and produced a movie or a tv show. And 
there I'm sitting in front of the TV actually liking it. Which essentially is the book just shown in a different 
light. Come to think of it, heck, I might even be interested in a book on how to create a movie by myself.

> Let's talk programming

Now consider programming for a moment. Painfully writing some algorithm or markup text that only nerds do
understand. What's the point? Code in a way is like writing a novel. To some people it makes sense, others
don't really like it and others take your work and put more effort into it to create something different.
It might look totally off from the original. Maybe this fancy new algorithm is simply used on the web for
an even cooler animation.

Just as I dislike books, but still find myself collecting bunches of them, you don't really need to like programming 
either. As long as you find something useful out of it... why not, right? With just the bare basics of programming would
you consider coding a website? Just like the actor knows how to read a script? Then...

> Welcome to web development

Welcome to the hipster world of software engineering. The ocean of weird stuff, with books you might start to enjoy 
eventhough you dislike reading them in general but want to look like a cool coder instead.
Looong story short: Hi... my name is Tom. Let's start hacking together.
