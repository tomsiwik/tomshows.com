# S01E01 - Editors

## Why?

This episode's goal is to introduce the audience (potentially new programmers) to certain types of editors that are useful for programming in a fun and catchy way.

## What?

There are three types of editors that can be used for programming:

## How?

It depends on your workflow what works best for you. In my own learning phase I have used Frontpage and Dreamweaver to create the basic layout of websites. Before I discovered CSS I wrote everything inline not using any strengths of CSS at all. However, after some time I started mixing my editor. Creating a basic template for my layout and refining and cleaning up with a code editor. A text editor I always used when I had a console open on my server.. so there is that. But then I found out about vim, but that's a story for another time.

Lets get started with coding. Now get a piece of paper, a pen and... wait a second. There's something wrong with the picture.

Nope. I want to prove a point. We all have written instructions before. E.g. in a shopping list we write down what we have to buy. Once in the super market we will know what we need. Or we just yolo and try to remember all the stuff. For a computer that's basically the same. It wants to know the instructions you give him to do stuff. If you write down jibberish... it will fail. If you write down unclear instructions it will do something different. Same as we do in the supermarket. 

Let me illustrate side by side how we can improve our writing / coding of instructions. There are three types of editors:

### Text-only editors: 

Used to write text just like in a typerwriter. The font is the same. Raw black ink on a white surface. Not much room for errors. No boundaries though. Distration free methodology.

> Editor (Markdown)

### Code editors:

These editors highlight your programming language and ship with additional features useful for programmers coding in one specific programming language. Some of the features are: code completion, linting, snippets or as simple as automatic indentation for cleaner code.

> VS Code (lightweight), 

### WYSIWYG editors: 
Instead of writing code you will be clicking with the mouse to most of the job done. Word is a WYSIWYG editor for writing. You instantly see how your page will look like when printed. In web development it's similar. You can see the prototype of a web page before you start coding it. Some tool will automatically generate code for you. The problem you have to trust these tools to get the job done correctly. 

> Dreamweaver, zeplin.io (stricktly not a WYSIWYG)
